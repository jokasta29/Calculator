# Calculator

Welcome to my first coding project on GitHub! This is a simple calculator application developed in Java, designed to help me learn and practice programming concepts. Although it's a basic project, it serves as a foundation for my future coding endeavours.

## Project Description

The Calculator is a graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a user-friendly interface with input fields and operation buttons, making it easy to perform calculations.

## Key Features

- Addition: Perform addition of two numbers.
- Subtraction: Perform subtraction of two numbers.
- Multiplication: Perform multiplication of two numbers.
- Division: Perform division of two numbers.

## Development Details

The Calculator application is developed in Java using the Swing GUI toolkit. It demonstrates my understanding of event handling, variable manipulation, and UI design.

I built this calculator as part of my learning journey in Java programming. It helped me gain hands-on experience with GUI development and enhance my problem-solving skills. While it may seem like a simple project, it showcases my dedication to continuous learning and my ability to build more complex applications in the future.

## Usage

1. Enter the desired values in the input fields.
2. Click on the operation buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.
3. The result will be displayed in the designated text field.

## Getting Started

To run the Calculator application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Compile the source code.
4. Run the compiled code.
